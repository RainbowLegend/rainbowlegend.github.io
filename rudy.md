Hello, welcome to our partnership, we are teaming up with Warren to bring you specialty GMK Rudy cables. I hope you enjoy this group buy. :)

These are [SE Cables](https://summitcables.com/#detachable), meaning they are deadlocked into a detachable design.

Every order will come with a custom card and custom box design. The group buy will run until the end of the month, or until 75 orders are received.
