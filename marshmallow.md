Hello, welcome to our partnership, we are teaming up with Thic Thock to bring you specialty Marshmallow cables :) I hope you enjoy this group buy.

These are [SE Cables](https://summitcables.com/#detachable), meaning they are deadlocked into a detachable design.

Every order will come with a custom card and custom box design. 

All switch orders with the cables will be handled by me.
